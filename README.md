# ETS-Autopilot

Hey! we are making an ETS Autopilot!

For now we maked some alphas that we won't public, but for the first time we public Beta of our program.

ETS Autopilot works on downloading telemetry data from your game, processing it and giving the output on W/S/A/D keys on keyboard that triggers gas, brakes, sterring.
We also giving you a 10 sec video of testing it around with Debug options to show you how it works! *it was 0.2.7 alpha*
